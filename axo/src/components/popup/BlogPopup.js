            We live in a world where we need to move quickly and iterate on our
            ideas as flexibly as possible. Building mockups strikes the ideal
            balance between true-life representation of the end product and ease
            of modification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mockups are useful both for the creative phase of the project - for
            instance when you're trying to figure out your user flows or the
            proper visual hierarchy - and the production phase when they will
            represent the target product. Making mockups a part of your creative
            and development process allows you to quickly and easily ideate.
